# Plugins

Repo for my plugins I guess. Basic repo structure and some of the code here was taken from the [KK_plugins](https://github.com/IllusionMods/KK_Plugins/tree/master) repository.

## ButtPhysicsEditor

Add extra sliders under the Body -> Lower Body tab that allow you to edit the physics of the butt.
- Stiffness
- Elasticity
- Dampening
- Weight

## KKPRimController

Adds a window to control KKPRim on the selected characters/objects in studio. It also allows you to load the values of one selected object and transfer them to another.

## PostProcessingEffectsV3

Massive credit to the original creator [@nHARUKA_KK](https://twitter.com/nHARUKA_KK). I just decompiled their plugin and added features present in the PostProcessingRuntime, but that were not added to the plugin.

## ProjectorUtils

For projectors that use the default Unity projector component. It does two things:
- Show a field of view of the projector showing where it will project
- Toggles the projector off if the object is off in the workspace

## SaveCameraObjectFov

Saves the current FoV to the camera objects (a little buggy)

## ShadowColorSwapper

Swap shadow colors to a configured value at the press of a keybind

## StudioPseudoMaker

A plugin that adds a lot of maker functionality in studio
